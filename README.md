AI Labs: [Mubashir]
Welcome to my AI Labs repository. This is a centralized hub for my research, experimental implementations, and explorations in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

---Overview
The goal of this lab is to move from theory to implementation. I use this space to document my progress in:

Computer Vision (CV): Object detection, segmentation, and generative art.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): LLM fine-tuning, RAG pipelines, and sentiment analysis.

Reinforcement Learning (RL): Agent-based simulations and game theory.

Model Optimization: Quantization, pruning, and edge deployment.
